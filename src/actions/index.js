import { ADD_ALLOY } from "../constants/action-types";
//It is a best pratice to wrap every action within a function. Such function is an action creator.
export const addAlloy = alloy => ({ type: "ADD_ALLOY", payload: alloy });
/* So, the type property is nothing more than a string.
The reducer will use that string to determine how to calculate the next state.
Since strings are prone to typos and duplicates itâ€™s better to have action types declared as constants.
This approach helps avoiding errors that will be difficult to debug.
